### Momentary Switch Component for Home Assistant
A simple switch component that once turned on will turn itself off. 

### NOTES!
This is a big update that moves the component over to the `config_flow`
system. The update should be seamless but if you run into any problems:

- You can revert back to the previous version (0.6) and it will still work.
- But if you can re-run the upgrade operation with debug enabled and create a
  bug report I would greatly appreciate it.

## Features
It provides:
* Run as momentary on or off.
* User configurable on/off time.
* Allow switch to be turned off/on early.
